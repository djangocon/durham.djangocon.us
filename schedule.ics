SUMMARY:Keynote - Power to the People who Teach the People
LOCATION:Junior Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Sheena O'Connell\n\nOne thing I absolutely love about the Python community is the fact that there are so many people with teacher's hearts. Teaching is an amazing thing, you can change a person's life just by spending some time with them, having conversations, showing them stuff.
 It's normal for people with software development skills to take on teaching roles - this might be through formal or informal workplace mentorship, community involvement, through being hired to teach or any number of other situations. Teaching and sharing knowledge is often a part of the job.
 Software development and teaching are two distinct skill sets. There is a science to teaching and learning - there is a robust body of knowledge, there are techniques, mindsets and patterns that make teaching effective. And, on the flip side, there are mistakes, anti-patterns and myths that are very much worth avoiding.
 It's perfectly normal for software developers to take on teaching roles and responsibilities, but it's exceedingly rar...

SUMMARY:The Magic of Dependencies Installing Themselves
LOCATION:Online talks
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Ilerioluwakiiye Abolade\n\nWhen you write a Python script that has dependencies, the standard has always been to use a separate file like requirements.txt or pyproject.toml (using Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language format) for handling the dependencies from external libraries. To share these scripts that are dependent on external libraries or other versions of Python, the process becomes more complex since the receiver has no choice but to create a new virtual environment with all the necessary dependencies. It becomes even more cumbersome in educational settings or among collaborators, where people might have different levels of Python expertise.
 With the introduction of PEP 723, we’ve brought simplicity to our code, as we can now embed dependencies directly in a single file script. In this talk, we will explore this new method that enhances our productivity by making it easier to share, deploy, and work with Python scripts, making working with Django closer to being seamless.

SUMMARY:Choosing Wisely: SPA vs. HTMX for Your Next Web Project
LOCATION:Junior Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Chris May\n\nAs web developers, we want to select the right architecture pattern for our projects. Web applications are inherently complex, and your choice will affect how you manage that complexity.
 Choosing a SPA pattern offers rich user experiences with rich interactivity and navigational transitions, but it also introduces complexity in state management, development cost, maintenance, security, and performance.
 On the other hand, server-rendered applications have been around for decades and have, until recently, struggled to match the user experience of SPAs. However, thanks to the evolution of browser standards and a crop of lightweight JavaScript frameworks, server-rendered apps have caught up and are once again a compelling option.
 In this talk, we'll delve into the factors influencing the choice between SPAs and server-rendered apps. We'll discuss considerations such as:
 
 State Management: Your choices affect how you'll need to manage the state of today's data-rich apps.

SUMMARY:path('/user/&lt;user.username:user&gt;/', view_profile)
LOCATION:Grand Ballroom III
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Willem Van Onsem\n\nSince Django-2.0, most people use path converters instead of regexes to describe the different URL patterns, and how these will trigger views. One can use the already builtin path converters, but also define new ones to parse dates, booleans, etc. more effectively. One can not only define a pattern, but also provide methods to convert between Python objects and URL fragments.
 That last feature can be used to automatically fetch model objects if the path contains the value for the primary key of the model object, or another unique field. We thus avoid writing queries to fetch the objects, but can also turn these into lazy objects where we postpone the roundtrip to the database, until the view needs that object, and thus save a roundtrip if the view has a codepath that does not require the object. Some databases also allow to combine multiple queries in one roundtrip, so we can combine all the objects that go to the same database, limiting the roundtrips further.
 A problem with path...

SUMMARY:Django Ledger | Uniting Developers and Accountants for Innovation.
LOCATION:Grand Ballroom III
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Miguel Sanda\n\nWhy Django Ledger?
 In the world of money apps, it's not just about transactions; it's about understanding how each financial decision ripples out. It's like dropping a pebble in a pond and watching the waves spread. Every dollar spent or saved can have a bigger effect than you realize. Django Ledger looks at both sides of the money picture because it is a double entry accounting system. This capability makes sure the insights aren't just whole, but you can act on them right away. It's like having a financial monitor that helps you see the bigger picture to take the right steps forward.
 I'm a developer, why should I care?.
 Developers aren't accountants, and accountants aren't exactly tech savvy. It feels like they're worlds apart. But what if we could bring them together? Imagine the power of combining the skills and knowledge of both sides to create something truly amazing and innovative.
 By using Django Ledger's capabilities to implement transaction blueprints, developers can e...

SUMMARY:Error Culture
LOCATION:Junior Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Ryan Cheley\n\nIn my talk titled &quot;Error Culture,&quot; I take a deep dive into the widespread but often overlooked issue of how organizations manage error alerts in technology and programming domains. The core of my discussion revolves around the concept of 'error culture'—the organizational tendency to ignore or minimize the significance of error notifications due to their frequency and the false perception of irrelevance. This paradox arises from our dependency on technology and the need to be alerted to failures, which results in a deluge of alerts, many of which are false positives or not actionable, leading to a dangerous desensitization to potentially critical warnings.
 Through my analysis, I address the serious consequences of error culture, such as the risk it poses by allowing significant alerts to slip through the cracks and the challenges it creates in integrating new team members who lack critical, undocumented knowledge. I pinpoint several root causes behind this phenomenon, inc...

SUMMARY:An Opinionated Guide to Modern Django Forms
LOCATION:Grand Ballroom III
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Josh Thomas\n\nDjango forms have experienced a significant renaissance within the Django community, after years of being what felt like an afterthought. Recent releases to Django have brought major improvements to built-in form templating and rendering. Instead of writing APIs to support forms rendered by the JS framework of the week, you can now use Django forms to render dynamic, interactive, responsive forms using only the batteries provided by Django, various third-party Django packages, and a handful of small, focused JavaScript utility libraries. And if you're willing to do a little bit of the leg work yourself, you can even get by without those third-party Django packages.
 In recent years, web development has started to see a shift away from complex JavaScript-heavy architectures toward more streamlined, HTML-centric approaches. Technologies like HTMX and Unpoly.js enable SPA-like experiences through server-rendered HTML, pairing nicely with Django’s template language. Similarly, libraries...

SUMMARY:Passkeys: Your password-free future
LOCATION:Grand Ballroom III
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Ryan Hiebert\n\nWe'll start at the beginning, with a simple username and password login form, and explore various approaches that the web has taken to try to solve it.
 We'll explore briefly OpenID (remember that?), Federation, Single Sign-on, Magic Links, and Login Codes, and why each of them has usability drawbacks that often mean that the username and password, especially combined with a password manager, just can't be beat for its user experience.
 Passkeys, however, are the better option that we've been waiting for. There are still some important trade-offs, but are a much better fit for consumer applications, with a user experience that is quite comparable to using a password manager.
 They can be a simple login button, or they can augment a username and password dialog very similarly to a password manager's autocomplete. Finally, we have a way that gives a good user experience and doesn't have us storing a potentially shared secret!
 Now that we've motivated passkeys, we'll explore how we ca...

LOCATION:Junior Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Sage Abdullah\n\nThe year was 2018. I was studying computer science at the University of Indonesia. I learned Django as part of a web programming course. At the time, Django felt just like any other framework out there – it's part of the tech stack that you use.
 A year later, I tried my luck with Django in Google Summer of Code. I took a deep dive into Django's codebase to implement the cross-database JSONField. The feature managed to make it in Django 3.1.
 Fast forward to now, I've got a job in the UK to work on the Django-powered Wagtail CMS.  Since then, I've had the opportunity to give talks at conferences in Europe and the US, including this one.
 This is a story of how Django changed my life people's lives – and how you played a part in it.
 In this talk, we'll go through:
 
 How Django can be used to teach web programming
 Django's participation in Google Summer of Code
 The awesome Django community and what it means for us
 What we can do to make Django change the lives of even more people...

SUMMARY:Keynote - How To Be A Developer and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves
LOCATION:Junior Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Mario Munoz\n\nIn the children's book &quot;Am I Even A Bee?&quot; by Felicity Muth, Osmia begins feeling uneasy when she notices that she doesn't look like other bees at all. She even notices that some flies, moths, or beetles look more like bees than she does. Her perspective changes when she bumps into another unlikely bee named Xyla.
 Our journey as developers sometimes follows a similar pattern. We may question what it means to be a developer in the first place and we're not quite sure how we fit in. On the other end, when we grow to be more experienced, we may inadvertently (or sometimes consciously) make it more difficult for others to belong.
 What is the role of community in an individual's sense of identity, and what are some of the ways that we try to come to terms with our place within the developer landscape? Let's find out... together!

SUMMARY:Seamless Transition: How I Converted an Existing MySQL Database to be Fully Managed by Django Migrations Framework
LOCATION:Online talks
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Daniel Ramas\n\nIn this presentation, I aim to demystify the complexities of database migrations in Django, catering to audiences with basic knowledge of the framework. Through a structured approach, I will delve into three key topics:
 
 Understanding Django's Migration Process: I will elucidate how Django determines and executes migrations, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that govern this process.
 Managing Dependencies in Migration Files: Delving deeper, I'll explore how dependencies within migration files impact the migration process, offering insights into best practices to navigate potential challenges.
 Practical Steps for Migrating an Existing Database: Leveraging my own experience, I will guide attendees through a step-by-step methodology for migrating an existing database to Django. This will include:
 
 
 Ensuring consistency in the id field type and configuring the DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting accordingly. I'll also address strategies for handling inconsistencies.

SUMMARY:Django + Alpine.js + htmx Ups & Downs
LOCATION:Junior Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Karen Tracey\n\nA few years ago we started to hear about the toolkits htmx and Alpine.js as a powerful combination that could  be used with Django to enable development of web applications that offer user experience akin to a single page application without the overhead of adopting a heavyweight front-end framework such as React. We were excited by the promise and adopted these tools in a few projects. In this talk we'll cover:
 
 The promise we saw in this tool combination
 The upside: examples of exciting wins in ways of using these tools that we recommend continuing
 The downside: some rough edges and areas of concern where we recommend caution
 Our overall assessment and plans regarding continued use of this combination

SUMMARY:PostgreSQL Beyond Django: Strategies to Get Max Performance
LOCATION:Grand Ballroom III
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Álvaro Justen\n\nPostgreSQL has been evolving in functionality and performance for decades, yet we often fail to extract full potential of the most advanced FL/OSS RDBMS. In this talk, I'll cover techniques for optimizing database performance and reducing space usage, beyond the basics of modeling and indexing and exploring powerful features such as triggers and bulk data import/export (not the Django one).
 If you want to handle millions of records easily and lower your infrastructure costs, this talk is for you! All the features mentioned will be presented using a simple Django app, created specifically for this talk. Topics to be covered:
 
 Introduction of the speaker
 Context about the dataset used on examples (52M+ rows)
 Issues caused by inadequate data modeling (from wrong types to field ordering)
 Understanding query execution
 Indexing, triggers, and other tools
 Using postgres' full-text search the right way
 Importing and exporting large amounts of data with Python

SUMMARY:If We Had $1,000,000: What Could The DSF Do With 4x Its Budget?
LOCATION:Junior Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Jacob Kaplan-Moss\n\nThis talk comes to you in three parts:
 Part 1: the DSF's budget. That (roughly) $250k annual budget: where does it come from and where does it go? I'll break down our various sources of funding and the major ways we spend money. I'll look mostly at the 2024 budget, but will talk a bit about how these numbers fluctuate over time.
 Part 2: If We Had $1,000,000. Let's imagine that magically our budget grew by 4x, to $1m a year. What would we be able to do with all that money? What a budget that size mean to Django developers and the global Django community. I'll talk about a all wish list items that I and other DSF members have -- things the DSF could be doing, but isn't, because we don't have the cash.
 Part 3: How Do We Get There? Unfortunately, we can't magic a 4x budget increase into existence — we have to do the work. How might we -- people both within and outside the DSF -- move towards increased funding. How can we incrementally move towards a future where the DSF is able to do...

SUMMARY:Maps with Django
LOCATION:Grand Ballroom III
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Paolo Melchiorre\n\nA map in a website is the best way to make geographic data easily accessible to users because it represents, in a simple way, the information relating to a specific geographical area and is used by many online services.
 In this talk, we'll see how to create a web map with the Python based web framework Django using its GeoDjango module, storing geographic data in your local database on which to run geospatial queries.
 Through this talk, you can learn how to add a map to your website, starting from a simple map based on Spatialite/SQLite up to a more complex and interactive map based on PostGIS/PostgreSQL.
 The talk will be structured like a hike in the mountains, it will start gradually and then increase in difficulty, stopping in key passages and then arriving at the final goal.

SUMMARY:Finding 2.0
LOCATION:Junior Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Marc Gibbons\n\nIn the world of library development, achieving version 2.0 often takes years, if it's achieved at all. Surprisingly, nearly 90% of packages published to PyPI using semantic versioning have a major release number of less than two. What makes reaching this milestone so elusive?
 If we applied software versioning to our lives, what version would we give ourselves? Perhaps in our formative years as students, we'd be a part of a 0.x series, and as we establish careers and become self-sufficient, we might progress to a 1.x scheme. But do we settle there?
 Just like software libraries, our lives require maintenance, and despite our best intentions, hacks and workarounds inevitably infiltrate our routines. As these multiply and compound, our health can suffer. Do we wait for disaster to strike? Or, can we take a proactive approach in not only addressing problem areas but also striving for more?
 Together, we'll explore certain risks to our wellbeing inherent to our profession as software de...

SUMMARY:You got that nice tech salary, now what?
LOCATION:Junior Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Tim Schilling\n\nTalking about finances is awful.
 There are several things I'd rather talk about with a group of strangers before finances. However, I believe that as a part of the tech community, there's a moral responsibility to make sound personal financial decisions because you earn a comfortable salary. I have made several mistakes along my career, and I'm probably still making some. The goal here is to make it a bit easier for us to have these conversations.
 I was the first in my family to graduate from college. One of my parents attended some college. They knew how to balance a budget, and they knew to max your employer's 401k matching program. Beyond that, there wasn't much of a plan.
 I didn't have any financial literacy when I entered the tech industry. In fact, I fell prey to a corporate insurance provider, bought an insurance-investment type product and contributed to it for years! I've left money in my savings account because I was scared of the market.

Many of us have spent our careers working asynchronously across International borders and timezones, but it's new to many of our clients, employers, and project stakeholders.
 In this talk, I'd like to discuss an important ingredient of successful asynchronous work: clear, concise communication. We'll discuss the importance of establishing clear boundaries and expectations early and often. We'll learn how to write excellent issues and pull requests, and how to tailor your writing to various audiences and purposes that arise in every project. We'll talk about when scheduling a meeting is actually a good idea, and how to communicate your successes, status reports, and blockers to those who need to know.

LOCATION:Grand Ballroom III
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Tim Bell\n\nKraken is an energy retail system built on Django. It is currently in use by over 20 clients around the world, including the largest energy retailer in the UK, Octopus Energy, which developed Kraken.
 When Kraken started out over 8 years ago supporting a single small client, applying Django migrations to make database schema changes was easy. Any migration that might be slightly dangerous was deployed outside business hours when the system was relatively quiet and there was no risk of disrupting the work of customer service staff. Kraken has now grown: the code has around 350 Django apps, with over 9000 migration files between them, and some database tables have billions of rows. With Kraken operating in 8 time zones around the globe, there is now no such thing as &quot;outside business hours&quot;. We have needed to find other ways of deploying migrations that might be risky.
 There are two main risk factors with applying migrations: taking exclusive database locks, and needing a l...

DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Thibaud Colas\n\nWe’ll first look at a quantitative assessment of thousands of Django websites on the web, to get a good picture of the Django ecosystem’s overall emissions, and understand which specific aspects of a project contribute to overall power and resource usage.
 We’ll then dive deeper on a single Django website’s energy use, studying djangoproject.com specifically, as a good example of a high-traffic website with a big footprint. We’ll use different performance testing, power measurement, and generic static analysis tools to understand how the site could be improved. We will review common issues, straightforward improvements, and more “pie in the sky” changes that are attainable with effort:
 
 Energy consumption of front-end technology (React, HTMX, vanilla JS)
 How design affects emissions (light vs. dark mode, image assets, fonts)

This site is used to find housing for thousands of low-income and homeless applicants a year.  The site handles over 10,000 monthly users at all times of day.  We've supported it in production for over five years, and deployed major new features continuously throughout that time.
 In this talk, we'll cover the best tricks of Django we used to build the site, as well as the biggest challenges we faced and how we solved them.  This includes:
 
 Using Django with Vue
 Keeping the site running fast despite high user load and large data volumes
 Managing duplicate applications in the system
 Regularly replicating gigabytes of data to a data warehouse
 Migrating data from 230 organizations into the system
 Zero-downtime deployments
 And more!

SUMMARY:Django UI Components for Perfectionists with Deadlines
LOCATION:Online talks
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Hernan Lozano\n\nWe pay great attention to how to write composable python code (with inheritance, decorators, modules, namespaces, etc). But when it comes to architecting the templates of your website, this is often overlooked, which rapidly degenerates in tons of copy&amp;paste of html, css and javascript.
 Some might say that this is what React or Vue (et al) are all about and already solve, but having to render HTML on the client can increase the complexity of the application (introducing build steps, another language, more dependencies, etc).
 Writing reusable and composable UI components can be achieved using the good 'ol django templates, with the help of some libraries to fill in the gaps (like django-components, django-cotton and TailwindCSS) that we will explore and suggest as a possible solution.

LOCATION:Online talks
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Jessica Garson\n\nOpenTelemetry (OTel) is an observability framework for cloud-native software. It provides standardized APIs, libraries, and tools to collect telemetry data such as metrics, logs, and traces. OTel is open source and vendor neutral, designed to work with any backend system.
 This talk will present several examples demonstrating why logs alone may be insufficient, along with the benefits of incorporating extra signals. These benefits include enhanced visibility into the execution flow and call timing, metrics on how users utilize services to pinpoint unnecessary ones, and the ability to detect patterns, such as peak usage times, which aids in production planning and scaling.

SUMMARY:Hidden gems of Django 5.x
LOCATION:Junior Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Sarah Boyce\n\nDid you know Django doesn't include any bug fixes or code optimisations in it's release notes?
 Each feature release (.0, .1, .2) only draws attention to a handful of features and classes many as &quot;minor&quot;, restricting them to a very small summarising bullet point.
 If you're looking for more reasons to upgrade to the latest feature branch or are curious about hidden gems - this is the talk for you.

SUMMARY:A Brief History of Django
LOCATION:Junior Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Frank Wiles\n\nWe are better programmers than historians or archivists.  There are a few great stories from the very early days of Django and how we managed to get it Open Sourced.   They are told in the hallways and at dinner amongst us old timers, but as Django is poised to enter its second decade it seems appropriate to record some of these stories for posterity.
 
 How did the make up of the team and The World Company itself impact early Django design choices?
 The infamous meeting where we got approval to Open Source Django
 Why the BSD license?
 Did we know what we were doing?

SUMMARY:Django & Celery: A love story of async proportions
LOCATION:Online talks
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Hugo Bessa\n\nDjango: A Framework for perfectionists with deadlines
 
 Batteries included: Security, Authentication, Authorization, Administration, robust and mature ORM, etc.
 Opinionated: Django defines the right path for doing things with it. And this open doors for building extensions.
 Strong Community: Open source packages, events, meetups, active development of the main framework
 
 Django's performance issue is a thing. We need to be careful with:
 
 Avoiding N+1s
 Caching
 Database indexes
 Data denormalization
 Running operations in the background
 
 Why running operations in the background?
 
 Each Django process loads the framework core
 It's expensive to have too many processes
 Requests hold one Django process each while being processed
 Requests should be processed quickly so we don't hold a process for too long
 We need to give feedback to the user quickly, so they can move forward with other operations
 
 What is Celery?
 Asynchronous task queue or job queue which is based on dis...

SUMMARY:WebRTC with Django, Channels, HTMX, and coturn
LOCATION:Junior Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Ken Whitesell\n\nAudio/Video conferencing has become standard in many areas for augmenting communications among individuals. Modern browsers facilitate this by including support for Web Real Time Communications (WebRTC).
 WebRTC itself is a point-to-point protocol, which means that two browsers using this for a video call are talking directly to each other. But, before that can happen, the those browsers need to know that each other exists and are looking to establish this connection. Then they need to negotiate the parameters for the connection.
 Then there are many network-related issues that can affect the ability for those two browsers to connect.  Things like firewalls and Network Address Translation (NAT) can affect how each side &quot;sees&quot; the other side, further complicating the situation.
 All these issues have known solutions. The WebRTC APIs have matured to the point where they can be considered reasonably stable and reliable. It has become practical to incorporate these solutions i...

SUMMARY:Django User Model: Past, Present, and Future
LOCATION:Junior Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Will Vincent\n\nDjango's default User model is now 20 years old and, in the words of former Django Fellow Carlton Gibson, a &quot;leaky battery.&quot; This talk examines the historical basis for User and past efforts to update or replace it. It evaluates current best practices, including custom user models and third-party packages, that support modern user authentication patterns. And it looks forward to future updates to User that support Django's goal of advancing the state of the art in web development.

SUMMARY:API Maybe: Bootstrapping a Web Application circa 2024
LOCATION:Junior Ballroom
DESCRIPTION:Presenter: Carlton Gibson\n\nThe last couple of years seem to have changed everything. Particularly with HTMX, but also related technologies like Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS, we've rapidly gone from a world where seemingly the only option was &quot;API First&quot;.
 This is the story of bootstrapping a new application in these latter days. On a core of almost old-school Django combined with HTMX, with a just sprinkling of Alpine.js, we've been able to build a rich and interactive web application, with hardly a JSON response or payload in sight.
 We'll show the integration patterns we've learnt, and what the limits of those might be.
 Finally, we'll look at what the future might bring. As we grow the application we're looking whether we will need edge computing, offline, and richer behaviour purely on the client. Is that the limit of the hypermedia driven approach? Is that where we need an API? It's not clear: it's still very much &quot;API Maybe&quot;.
